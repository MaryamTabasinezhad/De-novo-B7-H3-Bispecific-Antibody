# Protein Structure Prediction (multi-method, HPC)

Fold a protein with one or more of four state-of-the-art predictors and report
per-residue confidence (pLDDT), plus pTM where available, a confidence-band
breakdown, and a domain-resolved breakdown keyed to UniProt annotations. All four
predictors run as HPC jobs via `biomni.tool` HPC helpers. This skill was built and
verified end-to-end on real jobs (human B2M, mature chain); the exact commands,
output-file layouts, and pLDDT scales in `references/methods_reference.md` are
copied from verified runs, not from memory.

**Anti-improvisation contract.** Three summaries that used to be hand-rolled by
the agent — the confidence-band counts, the per-domain breakdown, and the
predictor/fallback disclosure — are now packaged functions that **derive from the
run's own produced files** (the pLDDT CSV, the fetched UniProt feature table, and
the run manifest). Do not re-implement any of them ad hoc; an earlier audited run
that did so contradicted its own fetched data (wrong domain boundaries; band
labels that did not match the binning).

## Scope

- **Does**: run AlphaFold v2, Boltz-2, Chai-1, and/or ESMCFold2 on a protein
  sequence; extract per-residue pLDDT normalized to 0–100; report pTM; save
  structure files (PDB/CIF), a per-residue CSV, and a confidence plot; produce a
  **confidence-band breakdown** and a **UniProt-domain-resolved breakdown** from
  packaged functions; disclose the predictor actually used and any fallback from
  the run manifest; and assemble a **final PDF report** (required terminal step).
  The **automated orchestrator** (`fold_orchestrate.py`: size default +
  poll-timeout + fallback) is a **single-chain monomer** path and **rejects
  complexes** rather than silently mis-folding them. Multi-chain **complexes** are
  supported only via a **documented manual path** (AlphaFold-multimer / Boltz /
  Chai per `references/methods_reference.md`; ESMCFold2 is monomer-only), not by
  the automated loop.
- **Does NOT**: dock small molecules as a primary task, run MD, do experimental
  structure comparison (RMSD/TM-align to a PDB) unless the user asks, or design
  sequences. Cross-method **comparison is opt-in**, not automatic. It does **not**
  fabricate domain boundaries: if no UniProt feature table is available, the
  domain breakdown is omitted with a stated reason, never approximated.

## Inputs (accept any one)

1. **Raw amino-acid sequence** — a plain protein string pasted by the user.
2. **UniProt accession or gene/protein name** — fetch the sequence from UniProt
   (`https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/<acc>.fasta`). For a gene/name, resolve to
   an accession first (UniProt search API, prefer reviewed/Swiss-Prot human unless
   told otherwise). **Default to the full canonical sequence.** Only use the mature
   chain (signal peptide / propeptide removed) if the user explicitly asks — and
   if you do, state which residues you removed. An accession is also what unlocks
   the **domain-resolved breakdown** (its feature table is fetched from UniProt).
3. **Uploaded FASTA** — one or more sequences from `/mnt/user-uploads/`.
4. **Multi-chain complex** — two or more chains (homo- or hetero-oligomer),
   optionally with ligands for Boltz/Chai (manual path only).

**Report** the resolved accession, length, and first/last residues so the choice
is auditable. In interactive use you may confirm the sequence before submitting
(folding jobs are GPU-expensive); for **unattended runs, do not block on
confirmation** — proceed with the resolved canonical sequence and record it in the
run manifest.

## Outputs (saved to `/mnt/results/`)

- Structure file(s): top-ranked model per method (`*.pdb` / `*.cif`).
- `<name>_<method>_plddt.csv` — per-residue pLDDT on a 0–100 scale.
- `<name>_<method>_plddt.png` — per-residue confidence plot.
- `<name>_<method>_bands.csv` — confidence-band counts/percent/mean, written by
  `extract_plddt.py` from the canonical `band_breakdown()` (item 2 below).
- `<name>_confidence_breakdown.json` — combined band + domain-resolved breakdown
  from `confidence_breakdown.py`. The domain section reports domain-tier features,
  a separate `sequence_features` category (signal peptide / propeptide / transit
  peptide / chain), per-segment `no_domain_feature` gaps (each listing any covering
  sequence-level feature), and truly `uncovered` residues; present when a UniProt
  feature table is available and **omitted-with-reason** otherwise.
- `<name>_run_manifest.json` — the chosen predictor, every attempt (method,
  job_id, status, seconds, outcome, n_files), the `poll_timeout_s` actually used,
  and the `fallback_trail`. Always written by the orchestrator so an unattended
  run is auditable.
- Use the pdf-report-generation skill to generate a pdf report with infographics (use the Biomni GenerateImage tool), methods, results, conclusions, figures, references, and next steps from all of the analyses.
- Report the mean pLDDT, pTM (if available), the confidence-band breakdown, the
  domain-resolved breakdown, **and which predictor was used / whether a fallback
  occurred** in chat.

## Method selection (size-first default)

This skill is built to run **unattended and robustly**. The default predictor is
chosen by **sequence length**, not by asking, because the fast MSA-free predictor
finishes reliably while the MSA-based predictors can stall on the cluster's
genetic-search step. Always **announce the chosen predictor and why**.

> **Model identity.** The fast MSA-free default is **ESMCFold2** (built on
> EvolutionaryScale's **ESM‑C / ESM Cambrian** language model), submitted to the
> cluster as `tool_id="esmcfold2"` (`esmc fold …`). This is **not** the older
> 2022 **ESMFold** (ESM‑2-based, Meta) — it is a newer, distinct model. The CLI
> method token and orchestrator parameters keep the legacy spelling
> (`--methods esmfold`, `--esmfold-max-len`) for backward compatibility, but they
> select **ESMCFold2**.

**Default rule (monomer):**

| Sequence length | Default predictor | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **≤ 400 aa** | **ESMCFold2** | Single-sequence LM, **no MSA** → finishes in seconds and never blocks on the MSA server. Strong accuracy on well-folded compact proteins. Pass `--max-length <len>` so 201–400 aa is accepted. |
| **> 400 aa** | **AlphaFold v2** (primary) | Beyond ESMCFold2's default range; MSA + templates. Runs **under the poll-timeout + fallback guard** (see Workflow) so a stalled MSA still yields a result. |

**Overrides:**
- If the user **explicitly names** a method (or asks for "highest accuracy" /
  AlphaFold), use it — but still run it under the poll-timeout + fallback guard.
  AlphaFold on a ≤ 400 aa protein is therefore *opt-in*, not the default.
- **Complexes (multi-chain):** the automated orchestrator
  (`fold_orchestrate.py`) is **single-chain only** and **rejects complexes**
  (it would otherwise silently fold one chain as a monomer). For a complex, build
  the multimer job **manually** per `references/methods_reference.md`
  (AlphaFold-multimer: `--model_preset=multimer` with one FASTA record per chain
  copy; or Boltz/Chai with one block per chain), poll it with a bounded timeout
  the same way, and extract with `scripts/extract_plddt.py`. ESMCFold2 is monomer-
  only and is never a complex option.
- **Ligands / nucleic acids:** use **Boltz-2** or **Chai-1** — also via the
  manual path (the orchestrator's automated loop is protein-monomer only).

The default `esmfold_max_len` boundary (400) is a parameter of the orchestrator;
raise or lower it if the user requests. Above the boundary, ESMCFold2 is still the
last-resort fallback (with `--max-length <len>`, accepting OOM risk).

Rationale for the size-first default (recorded assumption): ESMCFold2's inference
is ~seconds and MSA-free, so for the common case (small/medium monomers) it is
both the fastest and the most reliable choice; AlphaFold's advantage is mainly on
hard/low-homology or larger targets and depends on a healthy MSA server.

## Confidence metrics — and what the numbers do and do not mean

- **pLDDT** — per-residue local confidence, reported on a **0–100** scale (some
  methods emit 0–1 natively; `extract_plddt.py` normalizes). **pLDDT is the
  model's estimate of its own local accuracy (calibrated to lDDT-Cα), NOT a
  measurement of correctness.** A residue can be confidently wrong — high pLDDT
  does not verify the fold against experiment, the biological conformational
  state, or the effect of missing partners/ligands. Never present pLDDT as
  "accuracy."
- **A low-confidence region is often biology, not failure.** Intrinsically
  disordered regions, flexible loops, linkers, and termini genuinely lack a single
  fixed structure and *should* score low pLDDT — that is the model correctly
  reporting disorder. Treat low-pLDDT stretches as candidate disorder/flexibility
  and cross-check annotations before calling a prediction "bad."
- **The predictor changes what the number means.** MSA-based methods (AlphaFold,
  Boltz-2, Chai-1) draw confidence partly from evolutionary-coupling depth;
  single-sequence **ESMCFold2 has no MSA and no pTM**, so its pLDDT is calibrated
  differently. A pLDDT of 80 from ESMCFold2 is not interchangeable with 80 from
  AlphaFold. Always report which predictor produced the number.
- **Confidence bands (item 2 — one function, unambiguous boundaries).** Bands are
  **AlphaFold-calibrated**: very high, confident, low, very low. Compute every
  band count with the single packaged function
  `confidence_breakdown.band_breakdown(plddt)` — **never** an ad-hoc `cut()`/
  histogram. Its stated convention is **lower-bound inclusive, upper-bound
  exclusive**, so the label always matches the computation:
  `very_high = pLDDT ≥ 90`, `confident = 70 ≤ pLDDT < 90`,
  `low = 50 ≤ pLDDT < 70`, `very_low = pLDDT < 50` (exactly 50 → low, 70 →
  confident, 90 → very high). State that these cutoffs are AlphaFold-calibrated
  and only approximately transfer to Boltz-2 / Chai-1 / ESMCFold2.
- **pTM** — global fold confidence (0–1); available for AlphaFold (ptm preset),
  Boltz-2, and Chai-1. **Not available for ESMCFold2.**
- **ipTM** — interface confidence for complexes (Boltz/Chai).

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the input to a sequence.** Get the raw sequence (paste, UniProt
   fetch, gene→accession lookup, or FASTA). Report accession, length, and the
   first/last few residues. Flag signal peptides if the user wants a mature chain.
   *Why:* residue numbering in every output is 1..N of the **submitted** sequence;
   if you trim it, all downstream positions (and domain ranges) shift, so record
   what was submitted.
2. **Choose the predictor by size** (see Method selection). `len ≤ 400` →
   ESMCFold2; `len > 400` → AlphaFold v2; honor explicit user picks. A **complex**
   is not handled by the automated orchestrator — route it to the manual multimer
   path (the orchestrator rejects complexes). Announce the choice and the reason.
   *Why:* the predictor determines both reliability (MSA server dependence) and
   the *meaning* of the confidence number (see Confidence metrics).
3. **Check the ESMCFold2 length.** ESMCFold2's stock `--max-length` is 200; this
   skill passes `--max-length <len>` so anything ≤ the `esmfold_max_len` boundary
   (400 by default) is accepted. For very long sequences the orchestrator uses an
   MSA-based predictor instead (with ESMCFold2 as last-resort fallback).
4. **Run the orchestrator — DO NOT wait for a completion callback.** Prefer
   `scripts/fold_orchestrate.py` (`orchestrate_fold(...)` or its CLI). It performs
   the whole robust loop in one call:
   **submit → poll `hpc_get_job_results()` with a bounded timeout → detect
   stall/timeout/empty-output → fall back to a faster predictor → run the extractor
   on the winning output → write a run manifest.** It uses the exact verified
   commands/flags from `references/methods_reference.md` (AlphaFold
   `--use_gpu_relax=false`, `--model_preset=monomer_ptm`; Boltz-2
   `--num_workers 0 --use_msa_server --no_kernels`; Chai `--num-diffn-samples N`,
   **never** `--num-samples`; ESMCFold2 `--max-length <len>`), persists job IDs to
   `/mnt/shared-workspace/shared/`, and respects the **3-concurrent-GPU-job limit**
   (HTTP 429 → defer). **Poll parameters (defaults):** `poll_timeout_s=900`
   (~15 min/job), `poll_interval_s=30`, with an early-exit when a job is still
   searching with **0 output files** at the timeout bound. Raise `poll_timeout_s`
   for large/low-homology MSA targets that legitimately need longer. **Fallback
   chain:** ≤ 400 aa → ESMCFold2; > 400 aa → Boltz-2 then ESMCFold2
   (`--max-length <len>`); if all fail → proceed with whatever completed, else
   report a structured failure. A method is tried **at most once** and never falls
   back to itself. This design means the run **always produces a deliverable and
   never hangs** on a callback.
5. **Read the results from the orchestrator.** It returns / records mean pLDDT,
   pTM (if available), the selected model, the structure/CSV/plot paths, and a
   **`<name>_run_manifest.json`** capturing `chosen_predictor`, every `attempt`
   (method, job_id, status, seconds, n_files, outcome), the `poll_timeout_s`
   actually used, and the `fallback_trail`. (If you run a single method by hand
   instead of the orchestrator, still poll `hpc_get_job_results()` with a bounded
   timeout — never block on a callback — then run `scripts/extract_plddt.py` on its
   output directory.)
6. **Confidence-band breakdown (required whenever bands are reported).** Take band
   counts from `<name>_<method>_bands.csv` (written by `extract_plddt.py`) or call
   `confidence_breakdown.band_breakdown(plddt)` directly. **Do not re-bin pLDDT
   with an ad-hoc `cut()`/histogram** — the packaged function is the single source
   and its boundary convention is fixed and labelled (see Confidence metrics).
   *Why:* bands communicate what fraction of the model is backbone-reliable vs.
   likely disordered; if the printed cutoffs do not match the computation the
   summary is not reproducible.
7. **Domain-resolved breakdown (required whenever a domain breakdown is
   reported).** Fetch the UniProt feature table with
   `confidence_breakdown.fetch_uniprot_features(accession)` and compute
   `confidence_breakdown.domain_breakdown(plddt, features)`. **The ranges MUST come
   from that fetched feature table — never a partition you compose by eye.** The
   function fetches two tiers and handles the real shape of UniProt data:
   domain-tier **overlapping** features (reported as belonging to *both*, or
   flagged as an `overlap` segment listing every covering feature — never silently
   assigned to one); sequence-level features (**signal peptide, propeptide,
   transit peptide, chain**) reported in their own `sequence_features` category
   rather than dropped; domain **gaps** labelled `no_domain_feature`, each listing
   any covering sequence-level feature (so a low-pLDDT signal peptide reads as a
   signal peptide, not a blank); and only residues covered by **no** feature at all
   are flagged `uncovered` — never given an invented boundary. If no feature table
   is available (no accession, or UniProt returns none), the breakdown is
   **omitted with a stated reason** — never approximated. *Why:* proteins are
   modular — prodomains, linkers, and termini fold with different intrinsic order
   than catalytic cores — so per-domain
   confidence localizes where the model is trustworthy vs. where it reports genuine
   flexibility. Using self-composed bins instead of the annotated boundaries
   misattributes (dis)order to the wrong domain (the exact error this step
   prevents: residues at a domain seam were assigned to one domain when UniProt
   annotates two).
8. **Run-provenance disclosure + gate (required).** Read the manifest and, when
   `fallback_trail` is non-empty (the delivered numbers did not come from the
   requested/primary predictor), **disclose it in the results narrative — not only
   a caveats footnote** — using `run_provenance.render_run_provenance(manifest)`.
   The disclosure must state: which method was **requested**, that it was
   **cancelled at the poll bound while still running with 0 output files**, which
   method **actually produced every reported number**, the **poll bound actually
   used** (from the manifest's `poll_timeout_s`, not a documented default), and
   that the requested method **may have been obtainable with a longer bound**.
   Before finalizing the report, run the gate
   `run_provenance.check_report(manifest, report_text)` (CLI:
   `python scripts/run_provenance.py --manifest <json> --report <file>`); it
   **fails loudly** if a fallback is present but the disclosure is missing. *Why:*
   a stalled MSA can silently swap the predictor the user asked for; an
   undisclosed swap makes the confidence numbers mean something different from what
   was requested.
9. **Comparison (ONLY if the user asked).** After ≥2 methods finish, align all
   per-residue pLDDT vectors by residue index (they must be equal length — same
   input sequence), then compute: overall mean per-residue pLDDT, per-residue
   cross-method mean and SD, and the highest-disagreement residues (largest SD).
   Produce a per-residue overlay plot, a distribution plot, and a summary-stats
   table. Do **not** compute inter-method RMSD/TM-score unless explicitly asked
   (that is structural superposition, out of default scope).
10. **Figure/infographic value integrity (required whenever a figure or
    infographic states a number).** Every number shown on the summary infographic
    or a figure caption MUST be read from the exported tables at generation time,
    never typed by hand. Get the canonical `label: value` strings with
    `figure_value_guard.derive_infographic_values(<bands_csv|breakdown_json>)` and
    paste them into the GenerateImage prompt; do not type a percentage. Before
    finalizing, run the gate
    `figure_value_guard.check_infographic(prompt_text, <bands_csv|breakdown_json>)`
    (CLI: `python scripts/figure_value_guard.py --breakdown <table>
    --infographic-text <file>`); it **fails loudly** if any stated value disagrees
    with the exported table. *Why:* a hand-typed, silently-rounded value on the
    headline figure contradicts the very band table the report is built from (the
    exact defect this prevents: an infographic reading "Confident 70-90: 30%" when
    the band table says 29.48%).
11. **Final report (required terminal step — the run is not complete until it is
    produced).**
    Use the pdf-report-generation skill to generate a pdf report with infographics (use the Biomni GenerateImage tool), methods, results, conclusions, figures, references, and next steps from all of the analyses.

## Scientific caveats

- **pLDDT is confidence, not correctness.** It is the model's self-estimate of
  local accuracy; it does not verify the fold experimentally or confirm the
  biological conformational state. Do not report it as accuracy.
- **Low pLDDT often means genuine disorder/flexibility**, not a failed
  prediction. Disordered regions, loops, and termini legitimately score low; treat
  them as candidate flexible/disordered regions rather than errors.
- pLDDT bands are AlphaFold-calibrated; treat cross-method band comparisons as
  approximate. Use the single `band_breakdown()` convention so labels always match
  the binning.
- **Domain breakdown depends on UniProt annotation.** Ranges are taken verbatim
  from the fetched feature table; overlaps and gaps are real and reported as such.
  If you trimmed the sequence, UniProt feature coordinates will not line up with
  the submitted 1..N numbering — re-map or note the offset. With no feature table
  the breakdown is omitted, not approximated.
- ESMCFold2 (single-sequence) is typically less accurate than MSA-based methods on
  hard/low-homology targets and has no pTM; expect lower, differently-calibrated
  pLDDT.
- MSA-based methods depend on the MSA server being reachable; a failed MSA
  silently degrades quality — check logs (`hpc_get_logs`) if pLDDT is unexpectedly
  low.
- Use the **full canonical** sequence unless a mature/domain chain is explicitly
  requested; residue numbering in all outputs is 1..N of the **submitted**
  sequence, which will differ from UniProt numbering if you trimmed it.
- Complexes: ESMCFold2 is monomer-only; use AlphaFold-multimer, Boltz, or Chai via
  the manual path.
- Folding jobs are GPU-expensive and rate-limited (3 concurrent). Avoid redundant
  runs.
- **Unattended robustness (this skill's contract):** never block on a completion
  callback. Always poll with a bounded timeout and fall back to a faster predictor
  (or proceed with whatever finished) so a stalled MSA/genetic-search step can
  never hang the run. When a fallback fires, the delivered model is whatever
  finished — record it in the manifest and **disclose it in the results** (step 8),
  noting the size/quality tradeoff (e.g. ESMCFold2 has no pTM and is
  single-sequence) and that the requested method might have finished with a longer
  poll bound.

## Files in this skill

- `scripts/fold_orchestrate.py` — **the robust unattended driver.** One call
  resolves the sequence, picks the predictor by size, submits the HPC job, polls
  `hpc_get_job_results()` with a bounded timeout, falls back to a faster predictor
  on stall/timeout/empty output, runs `extract_plddt.py` on the winner, and writes
  `<name>_run_manifest.json` (chosen predictor + every attempt + `poll_timeout_s` +
  fallback trail). Python: `from fold_orchestrate import orchestrate_fold`; CLI:
  `python fold_orchestrate.py --seq <SEQ> --name <NAME> --out <DIR>
  [--methods esmfold|alphafold|boltz|chai ...] [--esmfold-max-len 400]
  [--poll-timeout-s 900] [--poll-interval-s 30]`. Use this by default instead of
  hand-submitting jobs and waiting for callbacks.
- `scripts/extract_plddt.py` — unified per-residue pLDDT extractor for all four
  methods (auto-detects method from an output dir, normalizes to 0–100, writes
  CSV + plot, and a `<prefix>_bands.csv` from the canonical `band_breakdown()`).
  CLI: `python extract_plddt.py --method auto --job-dir <dir>
  --out-prefix <prefix>`. Verified to reproduce AlphaFold 97.16, Boltz-2 93.73,
  Chai-1 95.95, ESMCFold2 86.47 on the B2M validation set. Called automatically by
  `fold_orchestrate.py`.
- `scripts/confidence_breakdown.py` — **canonical confidence breakdowns (single
  source).** `band_breakdown(plddt)` for AlphaFold-calibrated band counts with a
  fixed, labelled boundary convention; `fetch_uniprot_features(accession)` to pull
  the feature table (**domain tier + a separate sequence-level tier**: signal
  peptide, propeptide, transit peptide, chain); `domain_breakdown(plddt, features)`
  for the overlap-aware per-domain breakdown that reports `sequence_features` in
  their own category, labels domain gaps `no_domain_feature` (listing any covering
  sequence-level feature), and flags only truly `uncovered` residues. CLI:
  `python confidence_breakdown.py --plddt-csv <csv> --accession <ACC>
  [--name <NAME>] [--features-json <json>] --out <json>`. **Use these instead of
  hand-rolling bands or domain bins.**
- `scripts/run_provenance.py` — **predictor/fallback disclosure + gate.**
  `render_run_provenance(manifest)` builds the disclosure text from the manifest;
  `check_report(manifest, report_text)` fails loudly if a fallback occurred but the
  report omits it. CLI: `python run_provenance.py --manifest <json>
  [--report <file> | --render]`.
- `scripts/figure_value_guard.py` — **figure/infographic value integrity + gate.**
  `derive_infographic_values(<bands_csv|breakdown_json>)` returns the canonical
  `label: value` strings (band percents at the exported precision) to paste into
  the GenerateImage prompt so no number is typed; `check_infographic(prompt_text,
  <table>)` fails loudly if any value stated on the figure/infographic disagrees
  with the exported table. CLI: `python figure_value_guard.py --breakdown <table>
  [--infographic-text <file> | --render]`.
- `references/methods_reference.md` — verified commands, mandatory flags, input
  formats, output-file layouts, pLDDT extraction, band/domain breakdown semantics,
  and the poll-timeout + fallback policy. **Read this before submitting any job.**
- `assets/eval/` — offline unit tests for the band boundaries, the domain-breakdown
  overlap / no-domain-feature / sequence-level-category logic (the real Q8NBP7
  case), the provenance gate, and the figure-value guard.
