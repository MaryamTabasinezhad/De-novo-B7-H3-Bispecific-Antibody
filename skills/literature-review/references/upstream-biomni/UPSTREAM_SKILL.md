description: Use for any scientific or biomedical question that requires finding and
  synthesizing evidence across multiple papers, including general scientific literature
  reviews, key-paper searches, state-of-the-art summaries, and evidence synthesis
  on any topic. Searches peer-reviewed records, grounds claims in retrieved abstracts
  or open full text, and returns a cited narrative, structured evidence table, and
  PDF report.

# Literature Review

Align with the user on scope, search the peer-reviewed literature with the
Biomni `LiteratureSearch` tool, ground the synthesis in the retrieved records
(abstracts by default, with an optional deeper pass that reads open-access
full-text PDFs), and deliver a narrative review (with inline citations), a
structured evidence table, and a PDF report.

This skill is **search + synthesis**, not custom code: it relies on the
built-in `LiteratureSearch` tool and existing Biomni formatting skills rather
than shipping its own scripts.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- **Survey what is known** about a topic, method, mechanism, target, disease, or technology
- **Summarize the state of the art** or recent advances in an area
- **Pull together the key papers** and synthesize their findings
- **Build an evidence table** of relevant studies with structured metadata
- **Compare or contextualize** findings across multiple papers, including agreements, conflicts, and open gaps

This works for **any** topic — computational methods, molecular mechanisms,
clinical evidence, basic biology, tooling, etc.

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- **Deep preclinical extraction** (structured in vitro / in vivo experiment
  details per paper) — use `literature-preclinical` instead.
- **Quantitative meta-analysis / statistical pooling** of effect sizes — this
  skill synthesizes narratively; it does not pool data.
- **Methods/tool benchmarking landscapes** (head-to-head algorithm comparison
  with truth sets) — use `methods-landscape-review` instead.
- **Clinical trial landscape mapping** (by phase/sponsor/status) — use
  `clinicaltrials-landscape` instead.

---

## Step 1 — Clarify Scope (required, but skip what the user already gave)

Before searching, confirm the items below that the user has **not** already
specified. Ask them together in one concise round. For anything the user
skips, **proceed with a sensible default and state the default you used** —
do not block.

Clarify:
1. **Topic & scope** — what the review is about, and how broad vs. focused it
   should be.
2. **Key questions / angle** — what they want answered (e.g. mechanism,
   efficacy, methods comparison, controversies, what's new, practical
   recommendations).
3. **Time window** — recent only vs. comprehensive
   (*default: last ~5 years, but include foundational/older work when it is
   central to the topic*).
4. **Breadth / depth** — roughly how many papers and how deep
   (*default: ~25–40 papers across several queries*).
5. **Quality / study filters** — e.g. high-impact journals only, human studies
   only, specific study designs, minimum sample size (*default: no hard
   filters; prioritize relevance and quality during triage*).
6. **Evidence depth** — review from abstracts only, or also read **open-access
   full-text PDFs** for the most relevant papers? Full text is more thorough but
   slower, and OA is not available for every paper (paywalled papers fall back
   to their abstract). (*default: abstracts only; offer full text as an
   upgrade*). If the user wants full text, confirm roughly how many papers to
   read in full (*default: the top ~10–15 most relevant/pivotal*).
7. **Deliverables** — the PDF report is required; confirm whether to also return
   the narrative review and evidence table CSV (*default: both*).

Do **not** re-ask anything the user already provided. If the request is
already specific, state your assumed defaults briefly and proceed.

## Step 2 — Search with `LiteratureSearch` (multi-query + dedup)

Use the Biomni **`LiteratureSearch`** tool for all searching. Do **not** write
inline API/scraping code.

**Multi-query strategy (default).** One 20-paper call is usually too thin for
a review. Decompose the topic into several focused queries and run them, then
merge and deduplicate:
- Cover **subtopics / facets** (e.g. mechanism, methods, outcomes,
  applications, limitations).
- Include **synonyms and alternate names** (genes, drugs, methods often have
  several; e.g. `PD-L1` / `CD274` / `B7-H1`).
- Separate **"methods" vs. "results/outcomes"** angles when relevant.
- Use `max_papers` up to 20 per call; run as many focused calls as the chosen
  breadth requires.
- **Deduplicate** across calls — records accumulate in `references.jsonl`; drop
  duplicates by DOI first, then by normalized title.

**Map user intent to filters.** `LiteratureSearch` supports filters; apply them
from the clarification answers:

| User intent | Filter to use |
|---|---|
| Recent only | `year_min` |
| Exclude future-dated / cap year | `year_max` |
| High-quality / top journals only | `sjr_max` (1 = top quartile, 2 = top two, …) |
| Human studies only | `human=true` |
| Specific designs (RCT, meta-analysis, cohort, etc.) | `study_types` |
| Adequately powered studies | `sample_size_min` |

Note: filters apply to the Consensus provider; the Exa provider enforces the
year range only. If a filtered search returns too little, loosen filters and
rely on relevance triage instead.

## Step 3 — Ground the Synthesis in Retrieved Records

The inline one-sentence highlights are for **triage only** — they are not
enough to write from.

1. **Triage** on the one-liners to decide which papers are relevant and worth
   including.
2. **Read the full records** from `references.jsonl`
   (`/mnt/results/execution_trace/references.jsonl`). Each line is one record
   with `index`, `citation_id`, `title`, `authors`, `year`, `journal`, `doi`,
   `url`, `study_type`, `citation_count`, and the full `abstract`. Match papers
   by `index` (the inline `[N]`) or `citation_id`. Ground the narrative and the
   evidence table in these fields, not the one-liners.
3. For **pivotal papers** that need detail beyond the abstract (specific
   numbers, methods, subgroup results), read the open-access full text — see
   **Step 3.5** when the user has enabled full-text reading. A quick one-off
   `WebFetch` on the `doi`/`url` is fine even in abstract-only mode for a single
   key paper.

**Citation integrity (non-negotiable):**
- Cite **only** records actually returned by `LiteratureSearch`, using inline
  `[N]` where `N` is the returned record index.
- **Never invent** a PMID, DOI, title, or finding, and never attribute a claim
  to a paper that does not support it.
- Place `[N]` immediately after the claim it supports; combine as `[1, 4, 7]`.
- Use inline `[N]` only — do **not** append a separate "References"/
  "Bibliography" section (the platform renders the reference list).

---

## Step 3.5 — Read Open-Access Full Text (optional, only if enabled in Step 1)

**Skip this entire step unless the user opted into full-text reading.** The
default review is abstract-based (Step 3).

When enabled, deepen the synthesis by reading **open-access full-text PDFs** for
the most relevant papers. Default to the **top ~10–15 most relevant/pivotal**
records (or the count the user chose); read abstracts for the rest. Order
candidates by relevance to the user's key questions, breaking ties by recency
and citation count.

For each selected record, resolve a **legal open-access** copy from its `doi`
(both services are free; the second is a fallback):

1. **Unpaywall** — `GET https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/{doi}?email=YOUR_EMAIL`
   (use a real contact email; the parameter is required). If `is_oa` is `true`,
   use `best_oa_location.url_for_pdf` (preferred) or `best_oa_location.url`
   (landing page). This is the primary route to an OA PDF.
2. **Europe PMC** — query
   `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/search?query=DOI:{doi}&resultType=core&format=json`.
   If the record has `isOpenAccess=Y` / a `pmcid`, the OA full text is available
   from PMC (e.g. the `fullTextUrlList` entries or the `pmcid` article page).

Then **read the located full text with `WebFetch`**, passing a prompt that asks
for the parts a review needs (methods, key quantitative results, limitations,
and how the paper relates to the user's questions). For very large or scanned
PDFs, target the relevant sections rather than the whole document.

**Open-access only — do not bypass paywalls.** Use only legal OA copies
surfaced by Unpaywall/Europe PMC (or a publisher's own OA page). If no OA
full text is found, or retrieval fails, **fall back to the abstract** from
`references.jsonl` for that paper — never fabricate full-text content, and do
not attempt to obtain paywalled PDFs through unofficial sources.

**Track full-text provenance.** Note which papers were read in full vs.
abstract-only (this feeds an "evidence source" column in the evidence table and
keeps the synthesis honest about depth). Citation rules from Step 3 are
unchanged: cite by the `LiteratureSearch` index, and only claims actually
supported by what you read.

---

## Step 4 — Deliverables

Produce the required PDF report and the additional deliverables confirmed in Step 1.

1. **Narrative review (`.md`)** — an organized synthesis grounded in the
   retrieved records, with inline `[N]` citations. Structure the sections
   around the topic and the user's key questions; explicitly note where studies
   **agree**, **conflict**, and where the **evidence is thin or missing**.
2. **Evidence table (`.csv`)** — one row per included paper, built from
   `references.jsonl`: title, authors, year, journal, DOI/URL, study type
   (when available), citation count, and a short key-finding / relevance note.
   When full-text reading was enabled (Step 3.5), add an **evidence source**
   column marking each row as `full-text` or `abstract`.
3. **PDF report** — use `pdf-report-generation` unless otherwise specified,
   with the narrative synthesis, evidence table, and references. The workflow
   is not complete until the report is generated.

For a Word or slide deliverable, use `docx-generation` or `pptx-generation`
unless otherwise specified.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Too few results | Query too narrow, or name mismatch | Add synonyms/alternate names; broaden queries; loosen filters |
| Results off-topic | Query too broad or ambiguous | Split into more focused subtopic queries; add key entities |
| Thin synthesis | Wrote from one-liners only | Read full abstracts/metadata from `references.jsonl` before synthesizing |
| Missing specifics (numbers, subgroups) | Detail not in abstract | Enable full-text reading (Step 3.5), or `WebFetch` the DOI/URL for the pivotal papers |
| Filtered search returns little | Filters too strict (often `sjr_max`/`sample_size_min`) | Loosen or drop filters; prioritize relevance during triage |
| No OA full text for a paper | Paper is paywalled / not in Unpaywall or PMC | Fall back to the abstract for that paper; mark it `abstract` in the evidence table — do not bypass the paywall |
| Full-text run is slow | Reading many PDFs is heavy | Lower the full-text count to the top pivotal papers; abstracts cover the rest |

## Suggested Next Steps

After the review:
1. **Preclinical depth** — `literature-preclinical` for structured in vitro /
   in vivo experiment extraction on a target–disease pair.
2. **Methods comparison** — `methods-landscape-review` to compare tools/
   algorithms for a task with benchmarking evidence.
3. **Trial landscape** — `clinicaltrials-landscape` to map ongoing/completed
   trials for a disease area.
4. **Target genetics** — `open-targets` for target–disease association evidence.
5. **Formatted deliverables** — `pdf-report-generation`, `docx-generation`, or
   `pptx-generation` to package the review.
6. **Infographic** — if the user wants a visual summary or infographic of the
   review's key findings, use the `GenerateImage` tool.
