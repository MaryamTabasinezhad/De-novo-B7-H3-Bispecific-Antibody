## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill to prioritize therapeutic targets for a disease by querying the Open Targets Platform GraphQL API for target-disease associations, evidence rows, GWAS study metadata, and credible sets. It is suited to early target identification when you have an EFO disease identifier and want an integrated, datasource-aware ranking backed by public evidence.

Do not use this skill for causal inference, clinical recommendation, participant-level analysis, or raw GWAS summary-statistics retrieval. It retrieves public integrated association evidence only.

## Why X, not Y (READ FIRST)

- **API queries, not bulk download.** The Open Targets Platform GraphQL API returns bounded, structured records with release metadata. Bulk data dumps (e.g. FTP parquet) are a different access mode with different provenance; this skill stays in the API zone and labels any over-budget need explicitly rather than silently switching modes.
- **Bounded samples, not exhaustive sweeps.** Every paginated call is capped by configurable budgets (`max_entities`, `max_pages`, `max_rows`, `max_bytes`, `max_elapsed`). A retrieved target set is labelled `complete` or `bounded_sample`; it is never labelled exhaustive unless the API confirms it.
- **Discriminated semantics, not flat rows.** Each evidence record carries a `record_type`, `datasource_id`, `datatype`, `metric`, `scale`, and an interpretation boundary. Association scores are integrated prioritization metrics on a 0-1 scale, not effect estimates, replication, or causal proof.
- **Immutable operation ledger, not ad-hoc calls.** Every API operation is recorded in an append-only ledger with request hash, response hash, counts, and budget status. Bare HTTP POST calls bypass the ledger and are rejected by the shipped client helper.

## Inputs

- An EFO disease ID (e.g. `MONDO_0004975` for Alzheimer disease).
- Optionally a GWAS Catalog study ID (e.g. `GCST005194`).
- Optionally the number of top targets to retrieve (default `10`).

## Outputs

- `target_ranking.csv` — bounded top-N targets with overall and per-datatype association scores.
- `evidence_rows.csv` — bounded evidence rows for the top target, with discriminated datasource and datatype semantics.
- `operation_ledger.json` — immutable record of every API attempt with query, canonical request-body,
  and exact response-body hashes; byte counts, terminal state, and explicit retry/recovery links.
- `provenance.json` — API release label, version, access date, declared source mode, operation-ledger
  hash, and infographic prompt hash.
- `report_facts.json` — gated facts artifact feeding the report and source-witness checks.
- `report_content.json` — presentation-independent content shared by every compatible report-style provider.
- `report_structure.json` — provider-independent section and figure-placement contract.
- `root_bundle.json` — authoritative source mode, input identity, operation lineage, and member hashes
  for the complete root deliverable set.
- `report_open-targets.pdf` — the single canonical, provider-styled PDF report with task context, methods, results, deterministic figures, a GenerateImage infographic, references, and next steps.
- Use the report-style provider selected for this run to generate a pdf report with infographics (use the Biomni GenerateImage tool), methods, results, conclusions, figures, references (cited inline with [N] markers), and next steps from all of the analyses. If no provider was explicitly selected, use the default `pdf-report-generation` provider. Never infer a provider from customer, tenant, project, or account context. If an explicitly selected provider is unavailable or incompatible, stop and report a missing-provider error rather than falling back. Regenerate any figure whenever its underlying data changes.

## Figures

| Step | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Target ranking | `figures/figure_1_target_ranking.png` | Top targets ranked by overall association score (deterministic bar chart from `report_facts.json`). |
| Datatype contribution | `figures/figure_2_datatype_heatmap.png` | Per-datatype contribution scores for top targets (deterministic heatmap from `report_facts.json`). |
| Workflow infographic | `infographic_open_targets_workflow.png` | Qualitative, non-data-bearing infographic of the API workflow and API/bulk boundary, generated by the Biomni GenerateImage tool. |

All quantitative figures are deterministic and derived from `report_facts.json`. The infographic is qualitative only and carries no run-specific numbers, scores, rankings, variant IDs, or p-values.

## Clarification Questions

Resolve the complete user prompt with `scripts/prompt_contract.py` before asking anything. If its
status is `ready`, execute immediately with the returned inputs and record its
`selected_branch_ids`; **do not ask for confirmation, alternative inputs, validation depth, or
preferences already fixed by the prompt**. Apply the documented default `top_n=10` and the
evidence-only branch without asking when no GWAS/credible-set work was requested.

Ask one concise question naming only the unresolved field when the resolver returns `clarify`.
That state is reserved for a missing required disease identifier, conflicting disease/top-N/study
values, conflicting scope instructions, or a credible-set request with no GCST study identifier.

**scope** (single-select):
- `evidence_only` — Retrieve evidence for the top target only.
- `with_credible_sets` — Retrieve evidence plus GWAS credible sets and L2G predictions for the given study ID.

Derive `with_credible_sets` when the prompt supplies a GCST identifier or explicitly requests GWAS
or credible-set analysis. Otherwise derive `evidence_only`. Record the resulting
`<question_id>:<choice_id>` value in `selected_branch_ids` for the run receipt.

## Standard Workflow

### Step 0 — Resolve supplied inputs; ask only when required

Pass the full user prompt to `prompt_contract.resolve_prompt`. A `ready` result is authorization to
run the declared workflow with those values immediately. A `clarify` result identifies the exact
missing or ambiguous field; do not expand that into optional preference questions.

### Step 1 — Capture API release metadata

Run the `meta` query to capture `dataVersion` and `apiVersion`, binding them to the operation ledger and provenance.

```python
from open_targets_client import OpenTargetsClient
client = OpenTargetsClient()
meta = client.capture_release()
```

### Step 2 — Resolve disease identity and rank targets

Query `associatedTargets` for the given EFO ID, retrieving a bounded top-N set with datatype scores.

```python
from queries import REGISTRY
result = client.request(
    "meta_and_associated_targets",
    REGISTRY["meta_and_associated_targets"]["query"],
    {"efoId": disease_id, "size": top_n},
)
```

### Step 3 — Retrieve evidence for the top target

Query `evidences` for the top-ranked target with cursor pagination, bounded by configured budgets.

```python
evidence = client.request(
    "evidence", REGISTRY["evidence"]["query"],
    {"efoId": disease_id, "ensemblId": top_target_id, "size": 25, "cursor": None},
)
```

### Step 4 — Inspect GWAS study and credible sets

Query `study` metadata and `credible_sets` with L2G and colocalisation for the given study ID. Before integrating the study into the disease context, `run_analysis.py` checks concordance: the study's returned `traitFromSource` and `diseases` list are compared to the queried EFO ID. If concordance cannot be established, the study is labeled `independent_study_context` and excluded from target-support conclusions.

```python
study = client.request("study", REGISTRY["study"]["query"], {"studyId": study_id})
cred = client.request(
    "credible_sets", REGISTRY["credible_sets"]["query"],
    {"studyIds": [study_id], "size": 10},
)
```

### Step 5 — Serialize records through the discriminated schema

Pass all records through `semantics.py` serializers with `record_type`, `metric`, `scale`, `datasource_id`, and interpretation boundary. L2G and colocalisation records carry a null `datasource_id` with an explicit not-applicable reason.

### Step 6 — Build deterministic figures

Run `visualize.py` to produce the target-ranking bar chart and datatype heatmap from `report_facts.json`.

### Step 7 — Generate the qualitative infographic

Call the Biomni GenerateImage tool with the fixed prompt from `assets/infographic_prompt.txt` to produce `infographic_open_targets_workflow.png`. The prompt is qualitative and non-data-bearing; it is built from fixed package text, not from run results. Read the prompt file immediately before calling GenerateImage; do not edit it afterward. The prompt SHA256 and delivered image SHA256 are derived into `provenance.json` and the run receipt, pairing the tool-use id, exact prompt, requested filename, and successful result id.

### Step 8 — Build presentation-independent report content

After scientific lineage is finalized, run `report_content.py` to derive `report_content.json` and `report_structure.json` from `report_facts.json` and `provenance.json`. These files contain no palette, typography, logo, or customer styling. Every provider must render this same content and the existing deterministic figures; styling must not change, omit, or reinterpret scientific content.

### Step 9 — Final report (MANDATORY TERMINAL STEP)

**The run is not complete until this step has produced `report_open-targets.pdf` at the results root.**

Use the report-style provider selected for this run to generate a pdf report with infographics (use the Biomni GenerateImage tool), methods, results, conclusions, figures, references (cited inline with [N] markers), and next steps from all of the analyses. If no provider was explicitly selected, use the default `pdf-report-generation` provider. Never infer a provider from customer, tenant, project, or account context. If an explicitly selected provider is unavailable or incompatible, stop and report a missing-provider error rather than falling back. Regenerate any figure whenever its underlying data changes.

Resolve the provider only from immutable user-message evidence using `report_render_plan`. The bundled `build_report.py` is the renderer for the default provider only. When an explicit compatible provider is selected, render `report_content.json` through that provider and pass its completed PDF with `--provider-rendered-report`. That path is an artifact input, never provider-selection evidence.

For an explicit provider, run `run_analysis.py --content-only` first. This completes the unchanged scientific analysis and leaves the style-free content without publishing a PDF. After the selected provider renders that content, run `finalize_report.py --provider-rendered-report <workspace-pdf>` with genuine visual-review evidence. This second phase does not repeat API queries or scientific calculations. The default provider may complete both phases in the ordinary `run_analysis.py` invocation.

Publish exactly one file as `report_open-targets.pdf`. Do not preserve a Phylo canonical report and create an enterprise-styled companion. Do not overwrite the canonical PDF after finalization; render and inspect the selected provider's completed file first, stage it once, and then call `finalize_report_artifacts`.

Render the PDF to a fresh workspace file named by `workspace_report_file`; do not open or truncate an existing PDF on the object-backed results mount. The `staged_copy` call below publishes the completed file under its declared results-root name.

Then verify the run and write its receipt. `write_receipt` runs every gate — the report exists at the results root and is big enough, each declared figure is present and non-blank, the infographic lineage resolves to a fail-closed three-state outcome (`verified` when there is a unique same-id `GenerateImage` call/result pair with the exact prompt/filename and a delivered-image hash; `not_evaluable_platform_trace` when a genuine event is present but truncated/id-less/agent-writable/hashless; `failed` for contradictory or fabricated evidence), its decoded pixels match an embedded image on page 1, and the finished PDF carries the selected provider's required markers — then records what each one returned. A `not_evaluable_platform_trace` lineage is release-blocking unless `report_facts.json`, `provenance.json`, and the report all disclose that provenance is not independently verified. Run bundled commands through `run_bundled`, which writes the QC-owned `qc_run_log.json` from the subprocess result and output hashes. Do not author execution events or copy transcript identifiers. Record PDF visual review with an explicit state: only `pass` may complete the mandatory gate; `not_evaluable` remains false and blocks a successful receipt. Produce every source-witness artifact declared in `skill_contract.json`. Receipt v3 rejects unmatched hashes, unavailable provider evidence, partial page coverage, or source-value disagreement. It raises if any mandatory gate is not `pass`, **after** writing the receipt, so a failed run leaves the diagnostic behind.

```python
from report_content import write_report_content
from report_qc import (finalize_report_artifacts, finalize_root_bundle,
                       record_pdf_review, report_render_plan, run_bundled,

The v3 receipt is `run_receipt.json` at the **results root**, not beside this SKILL.md. It records
`report_content_complete` and `root_lineage_verified` in addition to the execution, output, figure,
provider-style, rendering, visual-review, source, and infographic gates. **Do not write this file by hand.**
`check_skill.py --require-run-receipt` requires the schema marker and per-outcome evidence, so a
hand-written block of `true`s fails.

## Scientific caveats

- Association scores are integrated prioritization metrics on a 0-1 scale, not effect estimates, replication, causal proof, or clinical validation. The `overall_association_score` field in `report_facts.json` records the value; the `INTERPRETATION_BOUNDARIES` in `semantics.py` record the boundary.
- The target sample is bounded, not exhaustive. The `completeness` field in `report_facts.json` is `complete` or `bounded_sample`; it is never labelled exhaustive unless the API confirms it. The `max_entities` budget in `open_targets_client.py` is `50`.
- L2G and colocalisation records carry a null `datasource_id` with an explicit not-applicable reason. The `FORBIDDEN_DATASOURCE_IDS` set in `semantics.py` is `{"ot_genetics_l2g", "ot_genetics_colocalisation"}`.
- GWAS Catalog study IDs are study-specific. `GCST005194` is coronary artery disease, not Alzheimer disease; do not conflate study disease with the queried EFO disease. The `studies` field in `report_facts.json` records the study trait. The `study_concordance` field records whether the study's returned trait/ontology matches the queried disease; non-concordant studies are labeled `independent_study_context` and excluded from target-support conclusions.
- The report derives executed-operation counts from `operation_ledger.json`. Five operations are executed in the representative run (meta, meta_and_associated_targets, evidence, study, credible_sets); nine operation families are registered and separately validated by live schema smoke. The report states these counts separately; no hard-coded executed count remains.
- Machine-readable JSON artifacts (`figure_payloads.json`) are serialized with `allow_nan=False`; non-finite floats are converted to `null` and remain visually distinct from numeric zero in the heatmap.
- PDF review evidence (text extraction, page renders, visual review) is hash-bound to the current final-PDF SHA256 and every artifact SHA256. A PDF overwrite, text substitution, or stale event fails the receipt gate.
- Visual review of rendered PDF pages is `not_evaluable` when inspection is unavailable. The receipt
  records that typed state as a false mandatory outcome; it never converts unavailable evidence to
  success. A separate reviewer must inspect every rendered page and record `review_state="pass"`.
- Infographic provenance is a fail-closed three-state outcome (`verified` /
  `not_evaluable_platform_trace` / `failed`) recorded identically in `report_facts.json`
  (`infographic_lineage`), `provenance.json`, the report, and the run receipt. When the platform
  trace truncates the GenerateImage args (or the event is id-less, agent-writable, or hashless) the
  state is `not_evaluable_platform_trace`: it is never reported as verified, and the run may complete
  only when every surface discloses that the image provenance is not independently verified and makes
  no verification claim. A `failed` state (contradictory, paraphrased, mismatched, duplicate, or
  fabricated evidence) is always release-blocking. The exact prompt is never inferred from a
  truncated string.

## Evidence Tier

Contract maturity: `evidence_validated`

This package carries a `skill_contract.json` (`phylo-skill-evidence/1`) with tested capabilities, source assertions with runtime witnesses, clarification branches, external-dependency budgets, and a PDF review specification. The auto validation matrix records `not_run` until the offline eval suite and a representative run have been executed; maturity upgrades to `evidence_validated` once they pass.

## Data Sources & Licenses

- **Open Targets Platform GraphQL API** — `https://api.platform.opentargets.org/api/v4/graphql`. Data under CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication); the API is free with no authentication. See `references/licensing-and-access.md` for access terms and verification.
- **GWAS Catalog** (integrated by Open Targets) — `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/`. CC0 1.0. Study metadata and credible sets are retrieved through the Open Targets API, not directly from the GWAS Catalog.
- **Ensembl / UniProt / ChEMBL** (integrated by Open Targets) — identifiers resolved through the API. See `DATA_SOURCES.md` for the full source list and licenses.

No participant-level data, raw GWAS summary statistics, or controlled-access data are retrieved.

## Common Issues

- **HTTP 200 with a body-level error.** The client rejects responses where `data` is null or `errors` is present, even with HTTP 200. See `failure_body_error.json`.
- **Empty semantic payload.** The client rejects responses that parse but carry no semantic content. See `failure_empty_semantic.json`.
- **Pagination overrun.** If a query exceeds `max_pages` or `max_rows`, the ledger records `bounded_sample` and the run continues; it does not silently loop. See `test_pagination.py`.
- **Missing infographic.** If `infographic_open_targets_workflow.png` is absent, blank, or corrupt, `build_report.py` raises `InfographicError` and the report is not published. The receipt's `infographics_generated_by_tool` gate also verifies prompt/tool/image lineage and content-identity embedding. See `test_infographic.py`.
- **Truncated GenerateImage args in the platform trace.** The platform execution trace can truncate the GenerateImage tool-call arguments (the fixed prompt is ~1124 chars; the trace caps args near 600 chars and appends a literal `[truncated N chars]` marker), so the exact prompt cannot be read. The `infographics_generated_by_tool` gate returns a fail-closed three-state outcome — `verified`, `not_evaluable_platform_trace`, or `failed` — computed by `report_qc.classify_infographic_lineage`. A truncated (or id-less, agent-writable, or hashless) but otherwise genuine event is `not_evaluable_platform_trace`: it never counts as verified, and it is release-blocking unless `report_facts.json`, `provenance.json`, and the report all disclose that provenance is not independently verified. Contradictory, paraphrased, mismatched, duplicate, or fabricated evidence is `failed` (always release-blocking). The truncated args string is never reconstructed into a prompt. See `test_repair_r4.py`.
- **Non-concordant GWAS study.** If the study's returned trait does not match the queried disease, it is labeled `independent_study_context` and excluded from target-support conclusions. See `test_repair_r2.py`.
- **Stale PDF review events.** If the PDF is overwritten after review events are recorded, the hash-binding check in `_pdf_review_evidence` fails the receipt. See `test_repair_r2.py`.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Run `schema_smoke.py` against the live API to verify all nine operations return schema-compatible records.
- Increase `--top-n` within budget to widen the target set, then re-run.
- Cross-reference top targets with druggability or tractability skills for modality assessment.
- Export `target_ranking.csv` into a downstream prioritization workflow.
